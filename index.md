# SAcommunity.org Drupal Migration Guide

## A playlist for volunteers

Hi everyone! This is a guide for the **sacommunity.org web-rebuild team** to understand the basics of Drupal migration. We are focusing mainly on migrating from **JSON to Drupal 11**.

These guides accompany my video series and serve as written documentation for the commands and concepts we use.

### The Guides

* **[Part 1: Key Concepts and Advice](./01-concepts.md)**
    * Terminology you need to know (Content Types, Fields, YAML).
    * My personal lessons learned (why you shouldn't trust ChatGPT too much!).
    * Recommended resources.

* **[Part 2: Getting Started & Navigation](./02-getting-started.md)**
    * Installing `migrate_plus` and `migrate_tools`.
    * Creating your first Content Type.
    * Importing your YAML configuration.
    * Running migrations via UI vs CLI.
